  "tests": [
    "Basic blood work including CBC, sugars, lipids, serology, renal function etc.",
    "Hormonal evaluation like thyroid function, testosterone levels if warranted.",
    "Semen analysis-this is just to have a baseline report though counts may vary widely from one test to the other and it should be stressed that low sperm counts are in no way an indication of an inability to father a child. With the reports, you will meet our Andrologist, for a physical exam as well as consultation to clarify your doubts and concerns."
